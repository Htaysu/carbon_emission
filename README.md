# Carbon Emissions Analysis & Visualization (SQL + Power BI)
 

## Project Overview
This project demonstrates my skills in SQL and Power BI through a comprehensive analysis of a carbon footprint dataset.The goal is to explore how greenhouse gas emissions are distributed across industries, companies, countries, and product lifecycle stages, and to identify key contributors and opportunities for reduction.

 ### Tools & Techniques Used
SQL: Data extraction, cleaning, aggregation, joins, CTEs, filtering, sorting, and ranking.

Power BI: Data modeling, DAX for custom measures, managing relationships, building interactive dashboards and reports.

## Dataset Overview
Source: The Carbon Catalogue (Nature.com)
Dataset: Contains product carbon footprints (PCFs) for various products and companies, measuring COâ‚‚-equivalent emissions across stages of production.

  Field Name	Description
  id	Unique identifier for each product record.
  year	Reporting year for the carbon footprint data.
  product_name	Name of the product being analyzed.
  company	Company responsible for the product.
  country	Country where the product is manufactured or reported.
  industry_group	Industry category (e.g., electronics, food, footwear).
  weight_kg	Weight of the product in kilograms.
  carbon_footprint_pcf	Total carbon footprint in COâ‚‚-equivalent (COâ‚‚e), covering production to disposal.
  upstream_percent_total_pcf	Emissions from upstream activities (e.g., raw materials, supply chain).
  operations_percent_total_pcf	Emissions during internal operations (e.g., manufacturing, packaging).
  downstream_percent_total_pcf	Emissions from downstream activities (e.g., transport, usage, disposal).

## Project Steps
1. Data Preparation
 - Table Creation: Created a carbon emissions table in SQL Server.

 - Data Insertion: Imported and loaded the dataset into the database.

2. Data Exploration & Cleaning
 - Checked for missing values and duplicate records.

 - Cleaned inconsistent values (e.g., trimming company/industry names).

 - Standardized data types and handled percent values stored as strings.

3. Data Analysis in SQL

 - Identified the most recent year for accurate reporting.

 - Calculated total carbon emissions by industry.

 - Identified top contributing companies and products.

 - Analyzed emission distribution across lifecycle stages.

4. Visualization in Power BI
 - Created interactive dashboards to visualize:

 - Emissions by industry, company, and country.

 - Stage-wise breakdown of emissions.

 - Trends over time and comparison between industries.

 - Applied DAX to create custom measures for average percentages, rankings, and totals.

## Key Analyses & Insights
âœ… Electronics, machinery, automobiles, and materials are among the top 10 industries with the highest carbon emissions.

âœ… The upstream stage (raw materials and supply chain) accounts for over 40% of emissions in most industries.

âœ… Downstream emissions (distribution, usage) are particularly high in industries like Capital Goods and Automobiles.

âœ… Significant emission differences exist across countries and companies, suggesting potential for better sourcing and production decisions.

## Conclusion
ðŸŒ± This project highlights the importance of data in driving sustainability. By analyzing product-level carbon footprints across industries, it reveals areas where environmental impact can be reduced â€” through smarter sourcing, cleaner operations, or better end-of-life disposal strategies.
